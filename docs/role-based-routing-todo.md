# Role-Based Routing & Sidebar To-Do List

## Sidebar
- [ ] Create a single role-based sidebar component that renders different menu items for admin and client users based on their role.
- [ ] Replace all sidebar usages in layouts/pages with the new role-based sidebar component.
- [ ] Update navigation links and menu items in the sidebar to match the new role-based routing structure.

## Routing

- [ ] (Optional) Extend the role-based route pattern to other shared paths (e.g., `/profile`, `/settings`) as needed.
